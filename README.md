# debug-control

## Overview
- How to detect and fix misleading or inaccurate outputs
- Anchoring responses to data, constraints, or reference material

---

## Learning Objectives
- Spot vague or fabricated information in outputs
- Rewrite prompts to add clear constraints
- Use delimiters and formatting to keep responses on topic

---

## Exercises of the quest

***Note: All submitted answers will be scanned using an AI Detector. If your response is identified as being generated by an AI tool (ChatGPT, etc.), it will be rejected. Make sure to write answers in your own words and avoid copying AI-generated text.***

- **Exercise 0:** Environment and Libraries
- **Exercise 1:** Reducing false or invented facts
- **Exercise 2:** Adding source or data constraints
- **Exercise 3:** Using delimiters to define context

---

## Virtual Environment
- Playground or chat interface for testing prompts
- Python 3.9+ installed locally (optional, for API use)

---

## Exercise 0: Environment and Libraries
**Objective:** Prepare the environment for work.
- Install Python (latest stable version, 3.9 or above).
- Verify installation with:
`python --version`
- Write and run a Hello, World! program.

---

## Exercise 1: Reducing False or Invented Facts
**Objective:** Identify and correct prompts that produce wrong or made-up information.

- Write a prompt that produces errors (example: “Give the capitals of five imaginary countries.”).

- Rewrite the prompt so it only accepts correct data (example: “List five real countries and their capitals.”).

- Compare both results and note the differences.

## Exercise 2: Adding Source or Data Constraints
**Objective:** Force responses to be tied to given material.

1. Write a factual question prompt.
2. Add instructions such as:
    - “Cite the source in your answer.”
    - “Use only the text provided below.”
3. Provide a short passage and check that the answer stays within the provided text.

---

## Exercise 3: Using Delimiters to Define Context
**Objective:** Restrict responses to a specific block of text.

- Place a passage inside delimiters (### or triple backticks).
- Add instructions: “Answer using only the text inside the delimiters.”
- Compare the output with and without delimiters to see the effect.

---

## Submission
Provide all exercises. For each exercise include the prompt, model outputs, and a brief sentence analysis comparing weak vs improved prompts. For Exercises 2 and 3, show outputs with and without constraints or delimiters to demonstrate the effect. Ensure all differences are clearly documented and outputs are structured for clarity.
