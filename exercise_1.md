# Exercise 1: Reducing False or Invented Facts
**Objective:** Identify and correct prompts that produce wrong or made-up information.
- Write a prompt that produces errors (example: “Give the capitals of five imaginary countries.”).
- Rewrite the prompt so it only accepts correct data (example: “List five real countries and their capitals.”).
- Compare both results and note the differences.

**First Prompt:**
Give the capitals of five imaginary countries.

**Its response:**
Here are five imaginary countries and their capitals:

- Aurelia — Capital: Solmere

- Dravaryn — Capital: Korthal

- Eryndor — Capital: Lunareth

- Valtheris — Capital: Mystralyn

- Zorathia — Capital: Nexovar

**Second Prompt:**
List five real countries and their capitals.

**First Prompt:**

Here are five real countries and their capitals:

Nigeria — Capital: Abuja

Canada — Capital: Ottawa

Japan — Capital: Tokyo

Brazil — Capital: Brasília

Germany — Capital: Berlin

---
**My observation:**

Looking at the result of both outputs, they are almost the same, and you wouldn't be able to differentiate real countries and the imaginary countries, except you are the one who gave the model the prompt. So, I think that's one of the dangers of AI, it has the power to give wrong answers that would seem correct, and if you are not carefull, you will take them as the right answers.
