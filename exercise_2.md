# Exercise 2: Adding Source or Data Constraints

**Objective:** Force responses to be tied to given material.

1. Write a factual question prompt.
2. Add instructions such as:
    - “Cite the source in your answer.”
    - “Use only the text provided below.”
3. Provide a short passage and check that the answer stays within the provided text.

---

**Passage:**
Solar energy is produced by converting sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic panels. Wind energy is generated by turbines that convert wind movement into mechanical power. Hydropower uses flowing water to produce electricity. Among these, solar energy is the fastest-growing renewable energy source globally.


**The prompt I gave to the model:**
Which renewable energy source is described as the fastest-growing globally?

- Use only the text provided below to answer the question.
- Do not use outside knowledge.
- Cite the exact sentence from the passage in your answer

**The model output:**
“Among these, solar energy is the fastest-growing renewable energy source globally.”

## My Observation:
After my observation, I noticed that the answer is staying within the provided passage. I also got to understand that the exrcise is trying to teach is prompt constraint control, and encourage spource grounding by the model.
